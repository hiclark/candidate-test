Welcome to the Clark Take-Home Code Challenge
Take a look at src/data.js. This is an approximation of what normalized billing data from our API looks like.

For this exercise, we'd like you to do the following:

calculate the total amount billed in dollars
calculate the total amount paid in dollars
calculate the total amount overdue (unpaid) in dollars
calculate the total amount outstanding (not due yet, not paid yet) money in dollars.
render these values to the screen along with an ordered list of the bills sorted by date and by category (outstanding, overdue, paid) - see the attached screenshot for reference.
Please test your work as you see fit, use git commits, and if you're comfortable use Flow to add type annotations.

Feel free to use any resources and packages available to you, including clark-utils.

When you've finished, zip your completed challenge and email it back to us.

To get started, edit src/App.js and save to reload.

If you have any questions, please reach out!
