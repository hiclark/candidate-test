      Take a look at <code>src/data.js</code>. This is an approximation of what normalized billing data from our API looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this exercise, we'd like you to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        calculate the total amount billed in dollars
      </li>
      <li>
        calculate the total amount paid in dollars
      </li>
      <li>
        calculate the total amount overdue (unpaid) in dollars
      </li>
      <li>
        calculate the total amount outstanding (not due yet, not paid yet) money in dollars.
      </li>
      <li>
        render these values to the screen along with an ordered list of the bills sorted by date and by category (outstanding, overdue, paid) - see the attached screenshot for reference.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please test your work as you see fit, use git commits, and if you're comfortable use Flow to add type annotations.
